Customer clustering analysis 

Clustering analysis is a technique used to group objects, observations or data points. It is commonly used in customer segmentation to identify purchasing patterns and behaviors. In general its a very useful technique with many applications in data analytics.

Where the idea is that:

Observations in the same group/cluster = similar

Observations from different groups/cluster = different

There are different clustering algorithms , however in this case we will try two of the most common k-means & DBSCAN.
