## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(factoextra)
library(clValid)
library(NbClust)
library(dbscan)
```

## 1) Downloading customer dataset 

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

# Set Kaggle credentials
Sys.setenv(KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR = "../../Kaggle/kaggle")  

# Download the dataset
system("kaggle datasets download -d vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python")


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
